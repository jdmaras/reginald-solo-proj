Reginald was my e-commerce app made to help me keep organized orders for the merchandise I was making based around my dog Reggie. The app was completed over a two week sprint and was the first time I had built anything form the ground up at Prime Academy.

I started off with basic wireframing and planning in Figma. Photos collected were all ones I had taken and some of the actual drawings of Reggie were commissioned from artists on Fiverr. 



##H2 Technologies Used
Javascript, Node, Express, React, React Redux, Figma, SendGrid, SQL, Photopea, and Tailwaind CSS

The 2 Technologies I wanted to highlight are SendGrid and Tailwind CSS since they were the two I had not learned during our course work. SendGrid was interesting to work a third party API especially since I had to deal a lot with their customer service in order to get it working. It helped similuate a working environment of having to wait on something that I had no control over and being able to use my time wisely and balance between working on multiple elements at a time. 

Tailwind was also an awesome way of manipulating CSS. I hadn't previously spent a ton of time working on CSS and the aspect of pushing pixels around in Tailwind went pretty well with their in-line styling.

The project made me far more confident in my own coding skills and was really great to also just get to see a picture of my dog the whole time.
